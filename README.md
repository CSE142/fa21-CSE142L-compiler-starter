# The Compiler

The process for getting started on this lab is the same as for Lab 1.:

1.  Visit [home page](https://github.com/CSE141pp/Home/), and click on the invitation link for this lab.
2.  Accept the invite.
3.  Connect to datahub, clone your starter repo, and get to work.

**REMINDER:** There is a pre-lab reading quiz due on Wednesday.  For this lab, I've
provided a [pdf of the lab](./Lab.pdf) so you can read it without actually
connecting to datahub.  You can take the quiz at https://www.gradescope.com/courses/316365.
